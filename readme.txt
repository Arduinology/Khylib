This is khyperia's Kerbal Space Program collective mod repository.


----- KESTREL -----

Kestrel is a multiplayer mod. 'Nuff said.


Release state:

Pre-alpha - current

Alpha (annouce to public)

Beta (public testing)

Release (all bugs mushed)



TODO:


Big:

Enable syncronization of all ships, not just the active one for each person.

More information transfer when inside 2.5km range, rotation, speed, perhaps input, etc.

Multiple people controlling same vessel.


Medium:

Sync entire ship state, parts, resources etc. Small goal: just sync parts.

Sync universe as in universal time, time warp rate, etc.

Timewarp issue. Look for multitudes of forum posts on multiplayer for ideas.

Launchpad conflicts.


----- HYPEREDIT -----

HyperEdit is a universe editor.


Release state:

Fully released


Note: I have nearly halted development for HyperEdit. I am working on Kestrel instead.
